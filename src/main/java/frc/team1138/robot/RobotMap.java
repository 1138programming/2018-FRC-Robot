/**
 * The RobotMap is a mapping where the ports, sensors and actuators are wired
 * into a variable name. This provides flexibility changing wiring, makes
 * checking the wiring easier and significantly reduces the number of magic
 * numbers floating around.
 * 
 * NOTE: We are localizing all variables this year. Therefore, to find their
 * values look in the local files that they are used in. They are in this code
 * as well just in case you can't find something, but are all commented out and
 * should not be changed from here, as it will have no effect.
